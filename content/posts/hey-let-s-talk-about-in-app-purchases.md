I think it is time we discussed the ecosystem around apps which are on the Apple App Store and around how it works with managed services and how there’s an almost two tiered system with who is allowed to keep a margin and who has to pay Apple 30% for card processing.  

Overall it is the 30% for card processing, if I developed an app and deployed it for free I would pay the Apple Developer Program fee but I would not pay Apple for anything else, I could have push notifications, wallet services, pretty much everything in my app and distribute it for free.    
The problem is where I want to have it as paid then I would need to pay around a 28% privilege for that based on most card payment provider fees, and overall that is a large amount of money to give up.    
Hey is the recent service that have had a problem with this.

Hey is an email service developed by Basecamp where there is a subscription of $99 a year for a rather advanced email service with privacy, no ads and a bunch of other features I am honestly over as email is a notification system for me personally and something I wish people would stop using professionally.    
The problem is that there are three kinds of apps when it comes to in app purchases:

1. **Reader Apps -** These you might as well call content consumption and cloud storage management apps, so your Dropboxes, Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Music, Ereaders etc.  They are allowed and allowed to have off app purchasing and still be on the App Store.
2. **Serious Business Apps -** If your app is a B2B or other kind of app of the sort like this then that is allowed to be behind a login where a subscription is out of it, looking at Google cloud and Microsoft 365 here for this
3. **Everyone Else -** Sorry but you need in app purchases

The problem is that there are those exclusions, especially around content consumption, could they say the app is for cloud storage that uses an email protocol rather than SFTP or HTTP Form Post? Maybe, I am sure Apple will likely have something against that but when they complain about an app having nowhere for a user to go when tens of apps of the first and second types have this as well - I don’t know?  It seems a bit confusing to me.    
The truth is, Apple make a lot of revenue from the App Store where services revenue (including Apple Music I cannot find it split out) brought in three times the amount that they get from iPad purchase revenue in Q1 2020. If it was split out I imagine even if it was 1% of this that is around $13m a quarter. It is probably a lot more than this.    
The issue is the size of the fee, it is not one which seems fair compared to other services and where the only benefit compared to free apps is card payment and invoicing 30% of revenue is eye watering.  If Apple reduces this to a more sensible value like 10% then they may find that acceptable and themselves generate more revenue from more services offering in app purchases purely for convenience and having a purchase system in the “reader” apps.
