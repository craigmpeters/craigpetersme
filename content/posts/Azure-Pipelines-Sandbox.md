When it comes to Azure sometimes it is good to be able to test what you are looking to do or propose so that later down the line when you are looking to implement something it works correctly because you tested it out and did not go solely by what documentation does or does not exist.  

With this in mind it is good to have some best practices in place as well:
- Policies in place so that people can create only what resources they are allowed to create
- A budget in place so that someone does not actually create something which spends a significant amount of money
- Control over that budget so that it terminates when it hits the budget
- Security in place to protect any connected resources, like on premise data resources or access to other test environments. Hybrid cloud resources essentially.
- Approval Workflow
