title: An ode to the greasy spoon
---

Well, not an ode, that would require a certain amount of poetic razzmatazz that I am not best placed to do myself.

I am writing this after reading on a post on the Bristol Subreddit of Reddit around the best greasy spoon on Gloucester Road, and a few recommendations in there were places where you could get a decent breakfast; but a greasy soon? None of them could hit the mark on what is essentially an icon of British culinary beauty where the ambiance is about as important as the food itself.

It is now on the following Saturday I decide to get a baseline for what I call a greasy spoon, something on where all the ones in Gloucester Road will be judged.
