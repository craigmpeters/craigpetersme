I am a big fan of chicken wings, thighs are a very close second and honestly the rest of it I could take or leave unless unhealthily prepared with 11 herbs and spices.

My main issue is with the fact that chicken wings have been missold by most places, and this stemmed from when I went to a chicken wing festival a couple of years back.

Here is a couple of wings I got from Gert Wings at the festival:

Now I wasnâ€™t a big fan of the buffalo but the other one was great, and here is my favourite which was from Greedys along with a Sriracha Thai Wing

However, when I buy chicken wings from a store they have both the flat of the wing and the drum (flats are superior) along with the much ignored ulna of the wing.

Why is it that when you order wings they count half a wing (as described by DEFRA on poultry standards to be the humerus,radius and ulna) and this is accepted? Where some places and you order wings and they count a full wing as a wing?

I feel this is something that does need some form of formal legislation or enforcement mostly as when ordering chicken wings there is a randomness around how many flats and drums I get and usually get less flats which is annoying.

Hopefully I am not the only one with this issue.
